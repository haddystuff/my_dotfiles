This is a template for a my python projects. It enforces a certain structure and best python development practices. Here are some of the features:

 - Pyproject.toml for project metadata and dependencies
 - uv for virtual dependency management
 - ruff or flake8 for linting
 - black for code formatting
 - isort for import sorting
 - mypy for static type checking
 - pre-commit for pre-commit linting and formatting checks
 - pytest for testing, codecov for coverage
 - mkdocs for documentation
 - taskfile for task automation(like makefile but better)
 - docker if project needs to be containerized
 - docker-compose if project needs to be developed in a containerized environment

Some of the features are optional and can declined during project creation.
